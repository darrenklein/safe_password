# Safe Password
> Chrome extension

Notify users if a password that they've entered in a form is on the list of the [100,000 most commonly used passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100000.txt).

## Use

If a user enters a commonly-used password on a site, **Safe Password** will attempt to notify the user by sending a system notification - users will need to make sure Chrome has permission to send "Banner"- or "Alert"-style notifications.
